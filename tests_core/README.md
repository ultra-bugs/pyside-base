# Core Framework Tests

## 🔬 Purpose
This directory (`tests_core/`) is dedicated to the **UltraBugz Pyside Base**.

- It contains unit and integration tests for modules located in `core/`.
- These tests ensure the stability and reliability of the platform itself.

## ⚠️ For Contributors Only
- **Developers relying on this Base**: You typically do not need to touch this directory.
- **Base Authors/Contributors**: Add new test cases here when extending `core/` functionality, or adding new feature to the CORE.

## 🚀 Running Tests
Refer to [Testing Setup](../docs/provided-by-base/TESTING_SETUP.md) or [Core Testing Docs](../core/taskSystem/docs/testing.md) for detailed instructions.
